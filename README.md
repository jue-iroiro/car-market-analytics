This is a car market analytics website for a market owner.
The users can see the the list of cars that they currently have.
(car data comes from a json file, no backend is included)
They can highlight and unhighlight cars across all pages. The highlighted car list is made to persist using useLocalStorage.
They can view some chart concerning the cars (chart.js is used here).
Pages are routed using react-router-dom.
Here are a few screenshots showing functionalities of the webpages.
You can take a look at the website at https://jue-iroiro.github.io/car-market-analytics/
